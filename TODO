Things to do in the neuro library.

misc -- the whole misc/ directory's source files require
	a major cleanup.

misc -- move Color conversion functions:
	 - The color conversion functions should be moved
	   to their own source file (Neuro_RGB**).

extlib (X11) -- Lib_SetColorKey has a memory leak:
	 - A very nasty one on that, needs to be fixed.

	* After checking with valgrind I actually found
	  out that the memory leak lies in the X11
	  client interface... I recently upgraded my 
	  Xorg from 6.8.2 to 6.9.0 and that's what I'm
	  getting now... A huge amount of memory leaks.

extlib (SDL) -- Needs a buffer to hold the v_objects:
	 - I just noticed that the SDL doesn't have a
	   v_object cleaner like the X11 driver, we
	   need to implement one as soon as possible
	   to avoid a maximum amount of memory leaks.
	   This should be pretty easy, just need to
	   use the same method as in the X11 driver.

extlib (SDL) on w32 -- bug with the bitmap loader:
	 - When the algorithm tries to load compressed
	   bitmaps(not all though), theres a bug that 
	   makes it do a death loop and/or a 
	   segmentation fault... When theres a death 
	   loop, it eventually ends up in a 
	   segmentation fault. I suspect that
	   the SDL.dll API differs from the linux object
	   and either the PutPixel function or a lack of
	   step for bitmaps is the cause of it.

	   * After checking the bitmap code, it seems
	   the bug is related the the bits per pixel
	   when creating a v_object.

extlib (SDL) -- There seems to be a memory leak:
	 - When running the "simple" example
	   project with valgrind, I get memory
	   leaks with SDL. This could be SDL
	   though because I couldn't trace the
	   leaks. About 27KB leaked.

extlib -- the fonts have a memory leak:
	 - The code to load the fonts need
	   to be checked for memory leaks
	   because valgrind currently says
	   theres about 27k of constant mem
	   leak, no matter how much fonts you
	   create. It could be a leak in freetype
	   itself. 
	*** NOTE Just checked and the values
	   are different and they are the exact
	   same on another project not at all
	   using the fonts...

debug -- The whole debug.c file needs to change:
	 - The module needs to be put into src/misc
	   in the first place and every Debug_ functions
	   need to be interfaced to Neuro_ functions.

debug -- The implementation needs a namespace method:
	 - In order to avoid module name conflicts,
	   we will need to implement some kind of namespace
	   that projects will set in a similar matter as
	   NEURO_MODULE_CHANNEL but rather globally to the
	   whole project this time instead of just per module.
	*** DONE but needs more work in order to make it easily added
	    into projects as this requires a macro to be set in a global header
	    in order to work... which would be a little hard to figure for people
	    that start to use the library.

bitmap -- Add checks to approve bitmap files:
	 - In order to make the bitmap loader more robust,
	   it is imperative to implement a set of checks to
	   see if the input file to be loaded by the bitmap
	   loader are really bitmaps. a minimal version was
	   done to check the magic word. We also need to put
	   a check to see if the data size are correct according
	   to a value in the header(something like data size).

general -- document the API (high priority):
	 - All the external functions of the API should be 
	   documented in a format that neuroman.tcl should
	   be able to parse.
	 - EBuf  [done needs to be revised]
	 - Video [not done]
	 - Events [not done]
	 - misc (including the extlib interface) [not done]

* extlib sdl -- default depth currently static 16 :
	- make this so it is settable and not just a static 16.

graphics engine : coredraw -- review and heavily test Graphics_RedrawSection :
	- I noticed this function is really the weak point of the painter's algorithm
	  and thus needs heavy testing and consolidation.

**goals for 0.50 :
	- Finish a full documentation of the library.
	- Make the project GPL v3 compatible and perhaps
	  completely make it GPL v3.

**goals for 0.60 :
	- Fix the bugs in the bitmap loading algorithm.
	- Code the new debugging method.
	- fix up the keyboard events in the SDL driver.
	- Clean up the source file in the misc directory.
	  All the functions inside other.c need to be placed
	  in meaningful source files.
	- Go through all the modules and implement the new
	  debugging method to them.

***goals for 1.0 :
	- make the extlib drivers their own shared 
	  objects that neuro could dynamically load
	  during runtime. A configuration file would
	  be used to set which one of the drivers to
	  load.
	- code openGL drivers for neuro, those drivers
	  would probably have more extensible set of
	  functions which could be used by the applications.
	  So I guess it would be a different branch than
	  the 2d extlib ones.

extlib X11 -- implement gfx shared memory :
	- in order to get far faster performances with
	  pretty much any graphical operations, the
	  addition of MIT shared memory for every images
	  will be used.

implement subprojects :
	libneuronet : done
	libneurogui : to do
	libgeometry : to do
	sprite module : to do
	image loader : to do
