Things to do in the neuro library.


graphics engine : 
	- fix the dynamic redraw of the tiles below the dynamic object, it does not seem to work
	  perfectly; it redraw a very small portion of the dynamic object instead of the tile below 
	  on the edges, barely noticeable.
	- also noticed bad redraws in isoe when the robot goes off screen; tiles around seems to
	  blink black very fast, barely noticeable. Confirmed this is a bug with type 0 or 3
	  bounds case. Quick fix done, need to test it.
	- implement a way to change a certain color into an image to support things like
	  font colors. Would need to be implemented low in the drawing process.
	- implement a fast independant alpha module, something called after the actual low level
	  draw.
	

network engine/module : 
	code it.

listimg module :
	move it to neuro.

sprite module :
	move it to neuro.

** bitmap loader module (X11) :
	- find a way to convert it so it creates an XImage directly (or indirectly by providing
	  its ressources so the X11 abstraction layer can take care of creating an XImage out
	  of those). Currently, the bitmap only saves to the pixmap format and then we push this
	  image to the pixmap standard lib in X11 which makes it all Very slow. 
	  This is an important change that will need to be worked on very soon because programs
	  depending on neuro will need to dynamically load images anytime to avoid using too
	  much memory.
	- Core bitmap should be made independant and remove the char *symbol of the color struct.
	- 24 BPP could be made faster if we had a map of the colors already inputed; Instead
	  of looping everytime the color buffer to see if a color was already added, we would
	  simply do a certain & with the color binary map to see if it was already added or no.
	  This method would use too much memory, need to find a way to implement this resonably.


*** core graphics :
	- Make an abstraction of the images themselves, only the screen would be in common
	  with the library in use (Would place neuro in direct competition with SDL).
	  Perhaps keep being semi independant(to, for example, keep using the ultra performant
	  X11 blitter) and only use our own blitter for special things like alpha rendering.

* add a function to Load bitmaps from memory :
	- Initially to support Unicode Truetype fonts but would probably be very useful for
	  other things too. DONE in SDL... TODO in X11(need to add new functions to bitmap module)

* video -- graphics module : 
	- Change the Dynamic type so it stays drawn until the external program explicitly tells it
	  to clean it. (Eventually, this will completely remplace the static dynamic method and
	  only this method will be used for both cases).
