Things to do in the neuro library.

extlib -- change the Lib_ prefix (low priority):
	- Change the Lib_ prefix of the extlib module to something less common so apps that use
	  Neuro won't have conflits if they themselves use the prefix Lib_.

* extlib sdl -- default depth currently static 16 :
	- make this so it is settable and not just a static 16.

extlib -- memory leak with the fonts :
	- I noticed we have a memory leak concerning our interfacing with the
	  library freetype2, we need to fix it asap.

graphics engine : coredraw -- review and heavily test Graphics_RedrawSection :
	- I noticed this function is really the weak point of the painter's algorithm
	  and thus needs heavy testing and consolidation.

***goals for 1.0 :
	- make the extlib drivers their own shared 
	  objects that neuro could dynamically load
	  during runtime. A configuration file would
	  be used to set which one of the drivers to
	  load.
	- code openGL drivers for neuro, those drivers
	  would probably have more extensible set of
	  functions which could be used by the applications.
	  So I guess it would be a different branch than
	  the 2d extlib ones.

extlib X11 -- implement gfx shared memory :
	- in order to get far faster performances with
	  pretty much any graphical operations, the
	  addition of MIT shared memory for every images
	  will be used.
