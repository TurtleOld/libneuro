Things to do in the neuro library.


graphics engine : 
	fix the dynamic redraw of the tiles below the dynamic object, it does not seem to work
	perfectly; it redraw a very small portion of the dynamic object instead of the tile below 
	on the edges, barely noticeable.

script engine :
	code it. 
	The script engine will need to include only simple things. 2 types of 
	variables, doubles and strings. A function to start and clean. A function to 
	pass a callback that the scripts can call easilly. Returning values of those would
	be returned to the scripts. operators would be the minimal ones : if (); then;  else;  fi;
	while (); do;  done;  for ( , ); do ;  done;.

sound engine :
	code it.

network engine/module : 
	code it.

* GUI engine :
	code it. Nothing too complicated is needed. In fact, I'm thinking of just ommiting
	the GUI code in neuro and just leaving it to programs under it.

listimg module :
	move it to neuro.

sprite module :
	move it to neuro.

** bitmap loader module (X11) :
	find a way to convert it so it creates an XImage directly (or indirectly by providing
	its ressources so the X11 abstraction layer can take care of creating an XImage out
	of those). Currently, the bitmap only saves to the pixmap format and then we push this
	image to the pixmap standard lib in X11 which makes it all Very slow. 
	This is an important change that will need to be worked on very soon because programs
	depending on neuro will need to dynamically load images anytime to avoid using too
	much memory.

	the core bitmap algorithm can also be made more performant. The key is loading the 
	colors from the palette using process_RGB() before we start messing with the pixels
	-- this will speed up the bitmap loading by 300% average for bitmaps that are not 
	24 bits per pixels.
	after that, we simply link the colors with the pixels. 
	Core bitmap should be made independant and remove the char *symbol of the color struct.
