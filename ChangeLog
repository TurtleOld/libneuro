version 0.50 - [under development]
	*Major
		[not yet finished]
		- Fully documented external interface functions 
		  using the special syntax needed to be
		  parsed by the application neuroman.tcl.
		  The documentation includes examples and full description 
		  of each of the the functions.

		[finished]
		- Spreaded the code of the video module (especially the code
		  concerning the painter's algorithm) among more than one
		  source file for a better split of tasks and thus a better
		  organisation of the code.

		[finished]
		graphics engine
		- fix the dynamic redraw of the tiles below the dynamic object, 
		  it does not seem to work perfectly; it redraw a very small 
		  portion of the dynamic object instead of the tile below on the 
		  edges, barely noticeable.
		- also noticed bad redraws in isoe when the robot goes off screen; 
		  tiles around seems to blink black very fast, barely noticeable. 
		  Confirmed this is a bug with type 0 or 3 bounds case. Quick fix 
		  done, need to test it.
		- [cancelled] implement a way to change a certain color into an 
		  image to support things like font colors. Would need to be 
		  implemented low in the drawing process. - won't do it
		- implement a fast independant alpha module, something called 
		  after the actual low level draw.

		[finished]
		bitmap loader module (X11)
		- find a way to convert it so it creates an XImage directly 
		  (or indirectly by providing its ressources so the X11 
		  abstraction layer can take care of creating an XImage out
		  of those). Currently, the bitmap only saves to the pixmap 
		  format and then we push this image to the pixmap standard 
		  lib in X11 which makes it all Very slow. This is an 
		  important change that will need to be worked on very soon 
		  because programs depending on neuro will need to dynamically 
		  load images anytime to avoid using too much memory.
		- Core bitmap should be made independant and remove the char 
		  *symbol of the color struct.
		- 24 BPP could be made faster if we had a map of the colors 
		  already inputed; Instead of looping everytime the color 
		  buffer to see if a color was already added, we would
		  simply do a certain & with the color binary map to see if 
		  it was already added or no. This method would use too much 
		  memory, need to find a way to implement this resonably.

		[finished]
		core graphics 
		- Make an abstraction of the images themselves, only the 
		  screen would be in common with the library in use 
		  (Would place neuro in direct competition with SDL). 
		  OR Perhaps keep being semi independant(to, for example, 
		  keep using the ultra performant X11 blitter) and only 
		  use our own blitter for special things like alpha 
		  rendering. (we chose the latter method :) )

		[finished]
		graphics engine -- drawing push functions to return address
		- In order for external applications to be able 
		  to destroy or modify drawing entries, the 
		  graphics engine's drawing push functions will 
		  now return the address of the elements it 
		  adds and new functions will be made to either 
		  modify those elements or destroy them. 
		  			- Nicholas Niro	 nik_89@neuroponic.com

	*Minor
		[to test]
		- Fixed the bugs concerning the new Draw function when 
		  cleaning and the whole Data to be drawn were previously
		  destroyed. It used to randomly make images blink around.
		  			- Nicholas Niro	 nik_89@neuroponic.com

		[finished]
		- Fixed the bugs that made destroyed and immediatelly added
		  elements show with either a black background or not showing
		  at all. (especially with fonts for now)
		  			- Nicholas Niro	 nik_89@neuroponic.com

		[finished]
		- Got rid of libxpm, we now directly use the pixel 
		  manipulation functions for the effect.
		  			- Nicholas Niro	 nik_89@neuroponic.com

		[finished]
		extlib X11 -- Lib_SetColorKey
		- I want this function to create a bitmask to the 
		  input image it recieves. Currently, it just sets 
		  a flag so libxpm makes the correct pixel type
		  transparent with a bitmask, but we'll get rid of 
		  libxpm very soon.

		[finished]
		graphics engine -- change draw_this_cycle flag behavior
		- Change this flag's behavior so it handles volatile
		  images the correct way.
		  			- Nicholas Niro	 nik_89@neuroponic.com

		[finished]
		graphics engine -- cleaning of same layers priority
		- We need to bring up a priority inside items with 
		  the same layers so that instructions to clean are 
		  actually PUT in the beginning of tasks to do and 
		  the rest after; So precedence would always put the 
		  cleaning tasks in the front line. This would avoid 
		  tasks to draw (especially text) never be done before 
		  it is cleaned... This might be a bug however because 
		  the redraw function is supposed to handle that...

		[finished]
		add a function to Load bitmaps from memory
		- Initially to support Unicode Truetype fonts but 
		  would probably be very useful for other things too. 
		  			- Nicholas Niro	 nik_89@neuroponic.com

		[finished]
		video -- graphics module
		- Change the Dynamic type so it stays drawn until 
		  the external program explicitly tells it to clean 
		  it. (Eventually, this will completely remplace 
		  the static dynamic method and only this method 
		  will be used for both cases).
		  			- Nicholas Niro	 nik_89@neuroponic.com

		[finished]
		extlib -- Add abstract Fonts (Unicode) support
		- Use freetype to handle the fonts.
		  			- Nicholas Niro	 nik_89@neuroponic.com

		[finished]
		extlib | other -- indirect extlib access
		- External applications should not at all call the 
		  functions directly from the extlib module. We 
		  need to have redundant functions that will serve 
		  as an interim between extlib and the extern 
		  application. I suggest NEURO.h get its include 
		  of extlib.h removed so external programs will 
		  have a warning if they use the extlib functions.

version 0.49
	*Major
		[finished]
		- Added 4 new functions to the extlib modules. 
		  All 4 are for the freetype library abstraction.
		  2 of those are core creation/cleaning functions and
		  the 2 others are to load a face and to render characters
		  in monochrome. 			
		  			- Nicholas Niro nik_89@neuroponic.com
		  
		[finished]
		- Added a few set of new functions to the graphics engine
		  that might replace the old dynamic/static method, see
		  the commit comment for more details.  
		  			- Nicholas Niro nik_89@neuroponic.com

	*Minor
		[finished]
		- Made the configure script more robust and included the
		  freetype library as a dependency.
