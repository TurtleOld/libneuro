version 0.49
	*Major
		- Added 4 new functions to the extlib modules. 
		  All 4 are for the freetype library abstraction.
		  2 of those are core creation/cleaning functions and
		  the 2 others are to load a face and to render characters
		  in monochrome. 			- Nicholas Niro  nik34_2000@yahoo.com
		  
		- Added a few set of new functions to the graphics engine
		  that might replace the old dynamic/static method, see
		  the commit comment for more details.  - Nicholas Niro  nik34_2000@yahoo.com

	*Minor
		- Made the configure script more robust and included the
		  freetype library as a dependency. 	- Nicholas Niro  nik34_2000@yahoo.com
