2007-07-14	Nicholas Niro	<nik_89@neuroponic.com>
	* src/extlib/x11.c :
	Removed dependency on X11/xpm.h so I had to
	use in struct functions for XPutPixel XGetPixel
	and XDestroyImage.

	* src/extlib/x11.c :
	Changed the low level XPutPixel() of the mask
	to the higher level Lib_PutPixel().

2007-07-09	Nicholas Niro	<nik_89@neuroponic.com>
	* src/misc/bitmap.c (bitmap_process2):
	Renamed to bitmap_process.
	
	* src/misc/bitmap.c (bitmap_process):
	Did fixes to the big endian compatibility code.

2007-07-07	Nicholas Niro	<nik_89@neuroponic.com>
	* src/debug.c (Neuro_DebugChannel):
	Added support even if the Init function wasn't
	called to allow external programs to use the
	debugging without having to use the X11 display.

	* src/extlib/sdl.c (Lib_CreateVObject):
	Made it so the function use default values in
	case 0 values were input for the masks and the depth.

	* src/extlib/sdl.c:
	Created a new static function that can be used to
	get default masks for the various pixel depths.

	* src/extlib/sdl.c (Lib_VideoInit):
	Made the function use the new default mask function.

	* src/misc/bitmap.c (process_Gradual_BMP):
	now creates a v_object with 0 masks to make use
	of the new defaulting code in the drivers.

	* src/extlib/x11.c (Lib_CreateVObject):
	changed an argument to XCreateImage to a static 16 value
	-- it used to put the default depth but when the default
	depth was 24, the function wouln't work, it takes only
	8, 16 or 32. This fixed an annoying bug in the 24 bpp
	depth.

2007-07-05	Nicholas Niro	<nik_89@neuroponic.com>
	* src/memory/ebuf.c (Neuro_AllocEBuf):
	Added a check to see if the buffer inside an
	ebuf element is not NULL. Also implemented
	the new debug channel into the module.

2007-06-03	Nicholas Niro	<nik_89@neuroponic.com>
	* src/extlib/x11.c (Lib_RenderUnicode):
	changed the static argument value 16 (bpp) that
	was used to create the v_object for the character
	to a call to get the current default depth in use.

2007-05-30	Nicholas Niro	<nik_89@neuroponic.com>
	* src/events/events.c (addKeyEvent): 
	removed keyboard limitation from only one callback 
	per keys to an infinite amount.

2007-05-29	Nicholas Niro	<nik_89@neuroponic.com>
	* src/extlib/sdl.c (u32 KeySymsTranslateTable): 
	added more elements to the keymap translation 
	table to support more keyboard keys. 
	Theres more work to come with this constant 
	to support all the keys.

2007-05-20	Nicholas Niro	<nik_89@neuroponic.com>
	* src/extlib/sdl.c (Lib_CreateVobject): made created
	vobject be created of the same resolution as the 
	screen as a default (16 bpp default). This is an
	attempt to hack SDL's palette when we load bitmaps.

	* src/misc/bitmap.c (processGradual_BMP): Changed the
	masks that will be passed to Lib_CreateVobject()
	so it only do 16 bpp masks.

2007-04-03	Nicholas Niro	<nik_89@neuroponic.com>
	* src/video/interface.c (Neuro_FlushDraw): removed
	a line that that filled a rectangle in black without
	redrawing the content below the location. This was
	a bug in the TODO list. I suspect this line was part
	of the old method to clean the old location of an image
	when it was redrawn at a different location.

2007-03-28	Nicholas Niro	<nik_89@neuroponic.com>
	* src/debug.c: created a new but temporary clone
	of the function Debug_Channel which is only meant
	to be a replacement until the real Debug_Channel
	function is made to support an interface function.

	* src/misc/bitmap.c: moved the inclusion of bitmap.h
	to the beginning of the include list instead of at the
	end so the flags from config.h were well used to include 
	zlib.h.

	* include/neuro/neuro_engine.h: added #include 
	<config.h> to include the defines from the 
	configure script into the project.
	
	* configure.ac: removed checks for c++ in the script.
	Made the project use autoheader so the compilation
	process takes less arguments. Started to implement
	the symbols libtool call so libneuro would only
	export specific functions.

	* src/Makefile.am: cleaned the script and started to
	implement a libtool symbol export file so libneuro 
	would be able to only export functions that we 
	choose.

	* ChangeLog: redesigned to suit the GNU coding standard.
	Please note that the file does not contain all the entries
	that it should for past work. Future work will all be logged
	however.

2007-02-24	Paul Keller	<geniack@neuroponic.com>
	* src/misc/bitmap.c: cleaned the file from any /* old */
	code and also those disabled by preprocessor macros.

2006-12-06	Nicholas Niro	<nik_89@neuroponic.com>
	* src/misc/bitmap.c: the bitmap loader was changed to
	remove any need of the library xpm. It now uses 
	high level pixel IO functions to load the bitmaps.

2006-12-04	Robert Lemay	<bob@neuroponic.com>
	* extlib/x11.c (Lib_SetColorKey): implemented a completely new
	fully working X11 transparency function that sets a certain color
	to transparent in a v_object. The old implementation was a hack
	to pass a non REENTRANT variable to misc/bitmap.c.

2006-10-02	Nicholas Niro	<nik_89@neuroponic.com>
	* video module: spreaded the code of the module (especially
	the code concerning the painter's algorithm) among more than
	one source file for a better split of tasks and thus a better
	organisation of the code.

2006-08-25	Nicholas Niro	<nik_89@neuroponic.com>
	* configure.ac: included the freetype2 library as 
	a dependency.

2006-08-25	Nicholas Niro	<nik_89@neuroponic.com>
	* src/extlib/x11.c: implemented fonts support.

2006-04-21	Nicholas Niro	<nik_89@neuroponic.com>
	* src/video/graphics.c: the functions to add dynamic
	and static types of images to the painter's algorithm
	were made obsolete by a new function which actually
	returns a context pointer in order to let the external
	code call interface functions for various purposes 
	like destroying/cleaning an instance directly, rather
	than automatically. This method opens the door to much
	better performances and far better flexability.
